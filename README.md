## Changelog

### [Date]

- Moved all files and folders from the `vcard-personal-portfolio/` subdirectory to the root of the repository.
- Updated all asset references in `index.html` (and other files) to use the new root-relative paths (e.g., `assets/images/...`).
- Verified that all CSS, JS, and image links are working with the new structure.
- Fixed 404 error on GitHub Pages by ensuring `index.html` is at the root.
